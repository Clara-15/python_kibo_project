# Instructions  

Congratulations on making it this far in your Future Proof journey! It‚Äôs been a fun-filled few weeks. Now it‚Äôs time for you to put your Python skills to test by building a program of your own design. The final project is a chance to  üôåüèø **celebrate what you‚Äôve learned** **üéâ**  and ‚ú®**explore the creativity of coding**.üé®

## Project Description

Your task is to create an interactive program that presents questions to the user, accepts the user's input and shows results based on the input. Prompts should have different choices, and respond with different messages based on what the user enters. At the end of the program, it should tell the user about their results.

## **Requirements**

- You must submit the **project code** and a **video**, according to the instructions below.
- You may work on the project alone or in a team. If you work on a team, teams can be a max size of 3 people.
- Your project must include the concepts you learned in the course. See the rubric below for more details

Update the file README.md with your names, the project's name, a description, and the video link once you are done.

###  **Be creative!** 

There's lots of different programs you could write that meet these requirements. It's also ok to work on a different project idea. If you have an idea for a different project that meets the rubric below, message Stanley in Discord *before* you start coding so he can give you feedback. Check out some project ideas and previous examples here:

### Before You Start

- Brainstorm and agree on the basic design for the project before you start coding. Draw out what the interactions should be.
- Use pen and paper to draw out the interactions before you code.
- Work on your project in steps, as we experienced during the course, and make sure you test each part before moving to the next.
- When you need help anytime,  **G**o **C**limb **K**ibo üòâ

# **Rubric**

We want you to build a creative project that you are proud to show off to your friends.  Below is how we‚Äôll be grading and giving feedback. 

**When you‚Äôre submitting your project, review this list yourself to see if there‚Äôs ways you can improve your work.**

### Functionality

- [ ]  Both parts of the project (the code and video) are submitted
- [ ]  The code runs without errors or exceptions
- [ ]  The video shows off the running program and some part of the code

### **Concepts**

Your code should demonstrate all the concepts you‚Äôve learned in the course. Your program‚Ä¶

- [ ]  takes input and displays output
- [ ]  uses multiple data types
- [ ]  uses at least one conditional statement
- [ ]  includes at least one loop
- [ ]  uses a list to keep track of data
- [ ]  uses at least one function

### **Clarity**

- [ ]  The names of variables tell you what those variables represent
- [ ]  The names of functions say what the function does
- [ ]  The code includes comments help to explain complicated parts
- [ ]  The program uses functions and loops to reduce unneeded repetition

### **Creativity**

- [ ]  The project and video show that you chose a topic that was meaningful to you
- [ ]  The project tries to do new things, that aren‚Äôt just the same idea as other projects you‚Äôve seen

## **Submitting your project**

1. Submit your final code in this repl.it. Each team member should copy and paste the code into their own replit and submit the project.
2. When your project is finished, record a video where you show your project to a friend or family member. 

- Schedule a time to show your friend your project. Record the session.
- Have your friend run your program and interact with it. For instance, if it‚Äôs a game, have them play the game.
- Then, show your friend the code that makes the program work. Give them a brief overview explanation of what the different pieces are doing.

Options for recording the video include free screen recording tools like [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) or [Loom](https://www.loom.com/), or you can use the ‚Äòrecord‚Äô option of a Zoom meeting.

Add a link to your video to the `README.md` file in your project.

‚ú®‚ú®Have fun!‚ú®‚ú®
